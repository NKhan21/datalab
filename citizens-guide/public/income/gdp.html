        <p>Most of the federal government's income comes from federal taxes.</p>
        <p>Taxes from individuals and small businesses make up a little less than half of all federal income. Besides income taxes, federal revenue comes from payroll taxes which are taken out of your paycheck to help fund programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Unemployment Insurance. Also, corporations pay taxes as part of doing business in the United States.</p>
        <p>The remaining sources of government income consist of excise, estate, and other taxes and fees.</p>

    <h1>In Fiscal Year 2017, the total GDP of the U.S. was $19.5 trillion.</h1>
    <p>The government collected the equivalent of 17% of GDP.</p>

    <h1>What's GDP?</h1>
    <p>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** measures the size of the nation’s economy in terms of the total value of goods and services that are produced in a year. Measuring the money collected by the government relative to GDP is a helpful indicator of the economy’s capacity to sustain the programs the government provides for the people and the government’s success in helping the economy grow.</p>
