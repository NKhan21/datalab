        <p>The $3.3 trillion the government collected last year keeps the federal government in operation.</p>
        <p>The majority of government income collected comes from individual taxpayers and small businesses. The second largest category comes from those taxes that come directly from your paycheck. These taxes support programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Unemployment compensation.</p>
        <p>Other sources of income include revenue collected from excise taxes, estate taxes, and customs duties. Government income also comes from payments made to federal agencies like the Post Office who sell products or services to the public, like stamps.</p>
        <p>We encourage you to explore the bar chart below.  It breaks down the various federal government income categories both in total dollars as well as by percent of income. What makes up individual income taxes? What exactly makes up Employment and General Retirement? What makes up the 12% of federal income that doesnâ€™t come from individuals or corporations?</p>
