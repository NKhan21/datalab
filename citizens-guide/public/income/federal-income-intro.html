<p>In 2017, the government collected $3.3 trillion dollars.  Where did it come from? In the federal government, money that the government collects are <em>receipts</em>, and most of government income comes from <em>federal taxes</em>.</p>
<p>Taxes from individuals and small businesses make up a little less than half of all federal income. Besides income taxes, <em>other</em> income is sourced from <em>payroll</em> taxes which are taken out of your paycheck to help fund programs such as Social Security, Medicare Hospital Insurance, and Unemployment Insurance.</p>
<p>Also, corporations pay taxes as part of doing business in the United States. The remaining sources of government income consist of <em>excise</em>, <em>estate</em>, and <em>other taxes</em> and <em>fees</em>.</p>
