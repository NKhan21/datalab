Money collected by the federal government is known as <strong>receipts</strong>. The majority of federal government income comes from <strong>federal taxes</strong>.</p>
<p>Taxes from individuals and small businesses make up a little less than half of all federal income. Besides income taxes, income is sourced from <strong>payroll</strong> taxes which are taken out of your paycheck to help fund programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Unemployment Insurance.</p>
<p>Additionally, corporations pay taxes as part of doing business in the United States. The remaining sources of government income consist of <strong>excise</strong>, <strong>estate</strong>, and <strong>other taxes</strong> and fees.</p>
