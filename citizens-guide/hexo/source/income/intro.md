# In 2017, the government collected $3.3 trillion dollars.  

Where did it come from? Money collected by the federal government is known as **receipts**. The majority of federal government income comes from **federal taxes**.

Taxes from individuals and small businesses make up a little less than half of all federal income. Besides income taxes, income is sourced from **payroll** taxes which are taken out of your paycheck to help fund programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Unemployment Insurance.

Additionally, corporations pay taxes as part of doing business in the United States. The remaining sources of government income consist of **excise**, **estate**, and **other taxes** and fees.
