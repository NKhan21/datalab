            <p>Most of the federal government's income comes from federal taxes.</p>
            <p>Most federal income comes from contributions from individuals and small businesses. Along with federal income taxes, the government collects payroll taxes. You may recognize these taxes on your paycheck that help fund programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Unemployment Insurance. Also, corporations pay taxes as part of doing business in the United States.</p>
            <p>The remaining sources of government income consist of excise, estate, and other taxes and fees.</p>
