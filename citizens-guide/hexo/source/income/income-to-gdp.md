    <h1>What's GDP?</h1>

    **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** measures the size of the nation’s economy in terms of the total value of goods and services that are produced in a year. Measuring the money collected by the government relative to GDP is a helpful indicator of the economy’s capacity to sustain the programs the government provides for the people and the government’s success in helping the economy grow.
