<h1>In 2018, the government spent $4.1 trillion.</h1>

<div id="copy">
    <p>Where does all the money go? The majority of government spending is concentrated on programs that ensure the health and well-being of the people of the United States. Why does the federal government do this? One reason is the Constitution! The Constitutionâ€™s preamble, which outlines the purpose of creating the new government is "to establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity."</p>
