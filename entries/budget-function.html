title: Understanding federal spending related to the government's main functions
description: Do you know what the government spends money on in support of its main functions? Budget Functions are categories that describe the purpose of federal spending (the why), and Object Classes are categories that describe what goods and services were purchased (the what). This visualization will shed light on both categories and help you draw connections between them.
