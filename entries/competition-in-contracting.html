	title="Why does the government use competition when issuing contracts?"
	body="It's the law. In 1984, Congress passed the Competition in Contracting Act, which requires federal agencies to use full and open competition when hiring contractors to provide goods and services. The law also spells out circumstances when agencies can bypass competitive practices, which include unusual and compelling urgency and national security. In many cases, federal agencies will pursue competition even when an exception to the law applies, as competition may help to provide a better selection of goods and services or better prices."
