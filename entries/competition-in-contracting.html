	title="Why does the government use competition when awarding contracts?"
  body="Competition is a healthy component of maintaining the integrity of the federal procurement process. Competition generates better quality and lower costs for goods and services purchased in support of agency services to the American taxpayer. The 1984 Competition in Contracting Act requires full and open competition while also allowing for exceptions in certain situations. In many cases, federal agencies will pursue competition even when an exception to the law applies, as competition may help to provide innovative solutions or better prices."
