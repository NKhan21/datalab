		<h3>What is the College Playbook?</h3>

		<br clear="all"/>
		<p>
				The College Playbook is an initiative that connects students and faculty
				with data from the U.S. Treasury for the purpose of developing analyses,
				conducting research, and facilitating learning about the federal budget and
				federal spending.
		</p>
		<p>
				The intended audience for this playbook includes instructors of federal
				policy and budgeting, directors of graduate programs, librarians dealing
				with data analysis and visualization, and students looking for a real-world
				project to flex their skills or to develop data-driven solutions.

		<h1>
				I. TYPES OF ENGAGEMENTS
		</h1>
		<p>
				We offer three main ways for us to connect, and we are happy to keep this
				list dynamic and growing! Let us know if you have suggestions for another
				type of engagement that better fits your needs.
		</p>
		<h2>
				Engagement 1: Use the data to learn about something else (e.g. statistics,
				econometrics)
		</h2>
		<p>
				Quantitative courses at every level require datasets for classroom lessons,
				homework and problem sets, exams, and more. Courses we believe are good
				fits for our data include those that focus on probability, statistics,
				econometrics, economics, federal budgeting, and data science.
		</p>
		<p>
				There are two high level options: (1) a prepared, clean dataset and (2) a
				real-world, messy dataset. Below we explain what we mean by clean and
				messy, as well as the circumstances that would call for each. Both options
				would involve students using Python, R, Stata, SAS, Excel, or some other
				software to analyze (or clean then analyze) the data.
		</p>
		<h3>
				<i>Option 1) Prepared dataset</i>
		</h3>
		<p>
				A prepared and clean dataset is one that is easier to use out of the gate
				because it is smaller in size and requires no data cleaning or data
				wrangling on the student’s part. That is, the data is in the desired
				format/shape to begin doing the desired analysis immediately. For example,
				there are no missing or duplicate values, and contain a limited number of
				fields/columns. These types of canned datasets are best for teaching
				materials in order to learn other concepts (e.g. regression analysis) and
				you don’t want to overwhelm the student with the pre-cleaning steps, where
				you risk losing the forest for the trees. They’re also helpful for problem
				sets or homework for these types of classes.
		</p>
		<h3>
				<i>Option 2) Data cleaning required</i>
		</h3>
		<p>
				In more advanced classes, the goal is to help the student understand how
				data will actually look when they first get it. This may require the
				student to handle missing values or de-duplicate records. Often original
				owners of data have it structured in a way to serve their own business
				purposes, and so data analysis may require the student to change the shape
				of the data entirely in a processing stage before they can begin any
				analysis. This is useful for students learning data wrangling and data
				cleaning techniques, learning more “real-world” data handling skills to
				prep datasets before they can apply statistical techniques, or those
				learning different languages typical to data science, e.g. R or Python.
		</p>
		<h2>
				Engagement 2: Use the data to learn about federal budgeting and/or federal
				spending
		</h2>
		<p>
				While the engagement above focuses on learning skills related to data and
				analysis, the courses mentioned are often agnostic to the actual content of
				the dataset. A second option is to use USAspending data to specifically
				focus on its content, such as courses touching on federal budgeting or
				federal spending processes. Programs interested in the data itself may
				include both undergraduate and graduate levels for finance, accounting,
				public administration, public policy, or business schools.
		</p>
		<p>
				Similar to above, this engagement would include two options: a prepared
				dataset or messy data that would require cleaning and preparation prior to
				consumption.
		</p>
		<h3>
				<i>Option 1) Prepared dataset</i>
		</h3>
		<p>
				See Engagement 1, Option 2.
		</p>
		<h3>
				<i>Option 2) Data cleaning required</i>
		</h3>
		<p>
				See Engagement 1, Option 2.
		</p>
		<h2>
				<strong>
						Engagement 3: Use the data for a consulting or capstone project (given
						a problem statement or question)
				</strong>
		</h2>
		<p>
				In this engagement, a student or student team uses data from the U.S.
				Treasury to identify a -world question to answer. Using the principles of
				user-centered design as outlined in the Resources section, the student team
				will identify a “client,” and the student or team will act as analysts or
				consultants. The team will conduct initial interviews with the client to
				determine how U.S. Treasury data can help answer a question or solve a
				problem, and the student team will research, perform analysis, and provide
				recommendations in order to answer the question or advise a particular
				course of action. While this type of structure is common for public policy
				students, it could easily be applied to a wide variety of settings where a
				“real-world” project is the goal, ranging from business to data science
				students, or even an interdisciplinary team. Students may form teams for
				classes or extracurricular clubs.
		</p>
		<p>
				The student team could, in consultation with their “client,” decide to
				produce a product or visualization instead of an analysis or
				recommendation. The focus on this would be less about gathering data to
				answer a specific question and provide a recommendation, and more on
				creating a product, tool, visualization, or other part of our team’s
				website and portfolio. Students of a wide range of backgrounds could
				contribute to this type of engagement, including: quantitative analysis,
				graphic design, UX, UI, design, data visualization, data science, computer
				science, and more. Students may form teams for classes or extracurricular
				clubs.
				
				Examples of software/languages used for executing tasks or analysis
				include: Tableau, R and R Shiny, Python, Stata, JavaScript, HTML, CSS,
				D3, React, and we’d be open to more!
		</p>
		<h1>
				II. ROLES, RESPONSIBILITIES, AND EXPECTATIONS
		</h1>
		<p>
				The roles, responsibilities, academic and time expectations vary for each
				type of engagement. We sketch these out below for each type of engagement,
				but these are not set in stone. These are completely open to discussion to
				ensure both the institution’s and our teams’ needs are being fulfilled.
		</p>
		<h2>
				Engagements 1 and 2: Using the data to learn (e.g. statistics or budgeting)
		</h2>
		<h3>
				<i>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</i>
		</h3>
		<p>
				Our team works with a professor to develop a useful dataset for their
				course, whether they need a clean and canned dataset or messy dataset. We
				would work with that professor to answer any questions and ensure she felt
				comfortable with the content and data structure in order to incorporate it
				into their teaching. These interactions can be via email, phone, screen
				shares, or video conferences—whatever works best.
		</p>
		<h3>
				<i>Academic &amp; Time Expectations</i>
		</h3>
		<p>
				Providing professors datasets and assistance through Engagements 1 and 2 is
				mainly an up-front, pre-semester activity, giving enough time for
				professors to ask questions, understand the data, and incorporate the
				dataset into their curriculum. Our team would work with the professor
				during this time, and then the professor uses the dataset during the
				semester at her leisure. We’re happy to field questions as they arise, but
				for the most part, the time required or interactions are mainly prior to a
				semester in order to get the right dataset for the course prepped,
				explained, and incorporated into the syllabus. We consider this a low level
				of commitment for both the institution and our team.
		</p>
		<h2>
				Engagements 3: Use the data for a consulting or capstone project
		</h2>
		<h3>
				<i>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</i>
		</h3>
		<p>
				Both the roles/responsibilities and time expectations are similar to above,
				with the expectation of slightly less “hand-holding” in this engagement.
				This engagement may be useful for substantial, long-term, and student
				driven projects, such as an undergraduate thesis, master’s capstone
				project, or even PhD thesis.
		</p>
		<p>
				We again would be happy to meet with the students to get them started, but
				we will not offer a problem statement or task to execute. We would be
				available for questions and regular communication and would like progress
				reports on a regular basis (e.g., once every two weeks). We would answer ad
				hoc questions in the interim. Lastly, we would attend a final presentation
				or demonstration of a final product.
		</p>
		<p>
				The students will be exploring the data themselves in order to decide on a
				problem they would like to explore and answer, or a visualization/tool they
				would like to build. The onus is on the student for the thought leadership
				and drive to push the project along.
		</p>
		<p>
				In this engagement, there may likely be an undergraduate or graduate
				advisor assisting the student. We would work with the professor, advisor,
				etc. to establish expectations regarding evaluation (e.g. grades, surveys,
				etc.).
		</p>
		<h3>
				<i>Academic &amp; Time Expectations</i>
		</h3>
		<p>
				These types of real world projects typically span a full semester, and the
				students would likely be in a course or club that provided expectations and
				support for this time period. Students may have academic requirements for
				the course that are not necessarily required by our team (e.g. course
				readings, literature reviews, etc.) and students are expected to complete
				both these and to provide a final product. A student on this type of
				engagement would be expected to put in the regular amount of hours expected
				for one semester-long course, or about 8-12 hour a week, including classes,
				coursework, meetings, and work time.
		</p>
		<p>
				Our team would put in more time up front to get the student group launched
				and answer any questions. Once they understand the task and scope, we would
				like a meeting on a regular basis (e.g., once a week or once every two
				weeks) and would respond to ad hoc communication in the interim. Finally,
				we would attend the final presentation and/or demonstration of the final
				product.
		</p>
		<p>
				The professors and our team would work together to establish what role our
				team would play in any evaluations (e.g. providing grades, answering
				surveys, etc.). We would like to remind you that this is up for
				negotiation, depending on your institution’s needs!

		</h2>
		<h1>
				IV. FINAL PRODUCT
		</h1>
		<p>
				The possible projects using this data could range from written analysis and
				recommendations to creating visualizations to creating a web-based tool to
				allow others to explore the data in a new way. Perhaps the final product
				answers a specific question, or it may allow others with subject matter
				expertise to discover insights themselves.
		</p>
		<p>
				While the final deliverable itself could range quite a bit, we expect three
				main components for any final product. First, the final product itself.
				Second, any code used to produce the final product. Third, a presentation
				on the process or journey the student/team took to arrive at their final
				conclusion or creation. We would expect that all three of these products
				could be made publicly available and potentially published to our main Data
				Lab website. Ideally, the student, school, or library would also be able to
				host these products so that they do not disappear within months, or when
				the student moves on. The school is welcome to publish and promote these
				products themselves as a way to tout the value of real-world partnerships,
				and we could link to these permanent locations where the student work
				lives.
		</p>
		<p>
				In summary, the three components of final products will be:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Product/application/analysis (hosted on a school server and/or published
					to our site)</li>
			<li>Code</li>
			<li>Presentation on process</li>

				<h2>III. Resources to get you going:</h2>
		</p>
				<h3>User-Centered Design Principles (picture)</h3>
		<p>
				<strong>
						While each user-centered design (UCD) process can look different for
						every team, there are four main stages to every UCD approach.
				</strong>
		</p>
		<ol>
				<li>Observe and learn about the people for whom you are solving a problem.</li>
				<li>Ideate or generate ideas about potential options that could address the	challenge your target audience faces.</li>
				<li>Create or make a prototype.</li>
				<li>Check or test the chosen prototype to see if it actually solves the
						problem people are facing.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
				In reality, however, this is an incredibly iterative process—the stages do
				not flow linearly from one to the next. You may begin brainstorming and
				realize you need more information, returning your team back to the
				observation and learning stage. You may build a prototype, test it, and
				find out it didn’t quite work, sending you back to the ideation phase.
		</p>
		<p>
				<strong>
						The ultimate purpose of UCD while tackling any challenge is to keep the
		people first and foremost to any solution – how would they        <em>naturally</em> navigate a situation or interact with something? –
						and build for them.
				</strong>
				The prototype should cater to the people facing the challenge, not the
				other way around; if you build a grand solution that no one will use, you
				don’t have a solution at all.
		</p>
		<p>
				<strong>
						The benefits of employing a user-centered design approach are numerous.
				</strong>
				The solution is much more likely to be effective and adopted by the target
				audience when it was built from the ground up with them in mind and tested
				throughout multiple phases. UCD can also reduce risk by allowing for quick,
				iterative stages that are nimble enough to make changes as new information
				is acquired and incorporated. Surprises are limited in the final release of
				the solution given the rounds of testing of the various prototypes
				throughout the lifecycle of the project. Once an idea moves into a
				higher-fidelity phase (e.g., a mock up that looks exactly how the phone app
				will be developed), resources (time, money, etc.) can be spent more
				confidently and wisely, knowing that quirks have been ironed out and
				unknown issues have been discovered and addressed earlier (e.g., with paper
				prototypes).
		</p>
		<p>
				<strong>
						We encourage teams that we partner with to adopt this approach.
				</strong>
				For example, once teams identify their target audience or who may be
				impacted by their project, we encourage students to go out and observe or
				interview people to gather initial data. Later, once ideas have been
				generated and a low-fidelity prototype has been created, go back out and
				check with people before switching fully into implementation mode. How
				would they use it? What do they expect each thing to do? Now that they have
				something to react to, are there other issues they foresee? Incorporate the
				users’ feedback into any final solution or prototype.
		</p>
		<h2>
				Finding Your “Client” (picture)
		</h2>
		<p>
				In a client-based project, students analyze a policy problem, challenge or
				missed opportunity facing the client and – with faculty guidance – develop
				recommendations to address it. Hence, a client with an interesting problem
				is key to producing a successful product or analysis.
		</p>
		<p>
				But finding a client and a policy problem can be challenging. Here we
				provide a few tips to begin this essential first step of your project:
		</p>
		<div class="playbook-indent">
			<p>
					- <strong>Follow your interests.</strong> Connect with an organization
					working on problems you’re interested in. For example, a local homeless
					service organization might be an appropriate client for students interested
					in preventing and ending homelessness or alleviating poverty. Learn about
					the organization’s goals and current initiatives. Then, work with the
					client to define a suitable and manageable policy problem or analysis that
					can provide value or insights to them.
			</p>
			<p>
					- <strong>Leverage your network.</strong> Reach out to your alumni and
					faculty networks and get an introduction to the problems and challenges
					their respective organizations are facing. Then, conduct initial research
					and identify an opportunity for a client organization.
			</p>
			<p>
					- <strong>Think local</strong>. Consider organizations/agencies you’re
					familiar with. These can be your high school, your city council, nonprofits
					in your community, or other small, public organizations where you may have
					a connection. Most of these organizations would be happy to have students
					completing a master’s degree working to improve the quality of their
					products or services.
			</p>
			<p>
					- <strong>Develop your subject matter niche.</strong> Take advantage of
					your student status and contact people on social media, via email or phone!
					Consider policy issues or topics in your field of study and share
					interesting insights or ideas. Next, meet with them and ask if they have a
					project that you can conduct for them for completion of your master’s
					degree. You should bring some examples, too.
