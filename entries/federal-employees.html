    Federal employees serve in highly varied occupations. The following interactive visualization lists the main occupational categories, each of which includes several job types that are grouped by function - for example, administrative, medical, legal, or engineering. The occupation data also makes a distinction between blue-collar jobs (for example, warehousing) and white-collar jobs (for example, information technology). Across all CFO Act agencies, the top two occupation categories are Administrative and Clerical and Medical, Hospital, Dental, and Public Health.
