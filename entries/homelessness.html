		<h2 class="entry-about-title">How individuals experiencing homelessness are counted</h2>
		<h3 class="entry-about-body">Determining how many people are experiencing homelessness at a given time can be challenging. People experiencing homelessness are counted once a year (in late January) by grantees who receive funding from HUD’s Continuum of Care program. This program — the largest federal program related to homelessness — requires grantees to collect reliable data on the total number of people experiencing homelessness who reside in the grantee’s geographic area.</h3>

		<h2 class="entry-about-title">Federal programs that address homelessness</h2>
		<h3 class="entry-about-body">The Department of Housing and Urban Development plays a lead role in federal efforts to address homelessness, though multiple federal agencies manage programs that provide services including education, employment, housing resources, and more. Our analysis identified 33 federal programs that explicitly flagged homeless individuals as beneficiaries. These included programs that named homeless individuals as primary targets of services or as one of the program’s target recipient groups.</h3>

		<h2 class="entry-about-title">How we conducted this analysis</h2>
		<h3 class="entry-about-body">We conducted this analysis using data from the following sources:
			<ul>
				<li>Federal grant award data from USAspending.gov</li>
				<li>Federal program descriptions from the Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA)</li>
				<li>Counts of people experiencing homelessness from the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) 2017 Point-in-Time count</li>
			</ul>

		To determine the amount the federal government spends addressing homelessness, we reviewed federal program descriptions using the CFDA,
		looking for keywords related to homelessness. We then developed a ranking system to assess whether individuals experiencing homelessness
		would directly benefit from these programs, keeping only the most relevant programs in our dataset.  We also categorized these programs
		by the type of service they provide. For example, the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program provides services to homeless veterans seeking
		meaningful employment, which we classified as employment-related. We presented these programs to the US Interagency Council on Homelessness,
		which provided feedback on our ranking system.<br/><br/>
		We used this dataset to identify all grant spending from USAspending.gov related to the programs we determined have a direct relation to
		homelessness programs. As part of our analysis, we identified two categories of grant awards in USAspending.gov data that are relevant to our
		work: those that were awarded to a Continuum of Care area (an administrative region recognized by HUD) or fell within its geographic area, and
		those that didn’t have specific location data or that applied to multiple areas within a state. To create our map visualization, we mapped
		funding amounts for the programs that fell within Continuum of Care areas using shape files provided by HUD. The data used in this analysis were
		updated as of January 2018.</h3>
