        <h3 class="entry-about-body">Determining how many people are experiencing homelessness at a given time can be challenging. People experiencing homelessness are counted once a year (in late January) by grantees who receive funding from HUD’s Continuum of Care program. This program — the largest federal program related to homelessness — requires grantees to collect reliable data on the total number of people experiencing homelessness who reside in the grantee’s geographic area.</h3>
