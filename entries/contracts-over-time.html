                Average contract spending over the fiscal year varies greatly throughout the year, notable seasons of increased contract spending are week 13, at the end of March, immediately preceding the end of the 2nd quarter of the fiscal year. Spending also tends to increase dramatically in week 38, at the end of September, which is the week prior to the end of the fiscal year.

            <p class="container-text">
              We can also see how contract spending has fluctuated over the course of the last ten years. We can see that similar yearly trends of increased spending twice a year are present when we look at weekly total contract spending from fiscal year 2007 through the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.

            <p class="container-text">
              Contract spending can be separated into two types of contracts issued, new contracts and contract modifications, which includes extensions, additional funding, etc. New contract spending by week seems to follow a similar trend to total contract spending.

              Contract spending can also be separated by the type of products and services each contract was used to acquire. Weekly spending by category of product or service shows that a large proportion of total contract spending is for professional services and Equipment, Facilities, and Construction. The lowest levels of reported spending go toward Telecommunications and Information Technology and Weapons.

                Total contract spending and the overall agency budgets that govern decisions about spending depend on Congressional appropriations. Appropriations bills are the vehicles used to determine programmatic funding levels across all federal agencies, which when passed annually provide agencies budget authority for a full fiscal year.
                In the event that congress is unable to pass an appropriations bill, Congress often enacts short-term spending bills called continuing resolutions. A Continuing resolution can be used to provide agencies with funding based on the level provided the prior year, up until a specific date, usually spanning a few weeks.
                Using contract data from fiscal year 2007 forward we will explore how these distinct budget actions may change contracting decisions.

          In this and the next several sections, we consider a Markov process with the discrete time space  and with a discrete (countable) state space. Recall that a Markov process with a discrete state space is called a Markov chain, so we are studying discrete-time Markov chains.
          Suppose again that  is a homogeneous, discrete-time Markov chain with state space . With a discrete state space, the transition kernels studied in the general introduction become transition matrices, with rows and columns indexed by  (and so perhaps of infinite size).
