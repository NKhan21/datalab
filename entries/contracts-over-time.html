            In fiscal year 2007 total contract spending was -mill, we can see how spending has changed year over year through 2017. In
            fiscal year 2017 total contract spending was ---million.

          <p class="container-text">
            Average contract spending over the fiscal year varies greatly throughout the year, notable seasons of increased contract
            spending are week 13, at the end of March, immediately preceding the end of the 2nd quarter of the fiscal year.
            Spending also tends to increase dramatically in week 38, at the end of September, which is the week prior to
            the end of the fiscal year.

            We can also see how contract spending has fluctuated over the course of the last ten years. We can see that similar yearly
            trends of increased spending twice a year are present when we look at weekly total contract spending from fiscal
            year 2007 through the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.

          <p class="container-text">
            Contract spending can be separated into two types of contracts issued, new contracts and contract modifications, which includes
            extensions, additional funding, etc. New contract spending by week seems to follow a similar trend to total contract
            spending.

          <p class="container-text">
            Contract spending can also be separated by the type of products and services each contract was used to acquire. Weekly spending
            by category of product or service shows that a large proportion of total contract spending is for professional
            services and Equipment, Facilities, and Construction. The lowest levels of reported spending go toward Telecommunications
            and Information Technology and Weapons.

        In this and the next several sections, we consider a Markov process with the discrete time space and with a discrete (countable)

        discrete-time Markov chains. Suppose again that is a homogeneous, discrete-time Markov chain with state space . With
        a discrete state space, the transition kernels studied in the general introduction become transition matrices, with
        rows and columns indexed by (and so perhaps of infinite size).
