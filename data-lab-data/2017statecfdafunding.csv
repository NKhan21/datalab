For additional details on the NPG, please refer to http://www.fema.gov/pdf/prepared/npg.pdf.","The law directs that the Local Boards, which manage the program at the local level, shall ""determine which private nonprofit organizations or public organizations of the local government in the individual locality shall receive grants to act as service providers.""

Also participating are thousands of independent nonprofits (such as Community Action Agencies and Food Banks and food pantries) which provide food and/or shelter services. Due to the broad category of people in need of such emergency services, the providers can include specialized groups such as domestic violence shelters, Native American organizations, and organizations providing food or shelter to: AIDS patients, handicapped individuals, the elderly, homeless veterans, non-wards of the State teenage runaways, and many other groups with emergency food and shelter needs. As noted earlier, the decisions on selections are made through the consensus of the Local Board as they have assessed their community's most urgent needs.
