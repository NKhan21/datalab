To achieve this mission, NINR supports and conducts clinical and basic research and research training on health and illness, research that spans and integrates the behavioral and biological sciences, and that develops the scientific basis for clinical practice. From premature infants in neonatal intensive care units, to adolescents living with diabetes, to elderly cancer survivors coping with pain, nursing research develops the science to help people strengthen the quality of their lives. Nursing science transcends the boundaries of disease and research disciplines to better understand the experiences of individuals and families living with illness and to develop personalized approaches that maximize health and well-being for individuals at all stages of life, across diverse populations and settings. NINR’s scientific programs are organized around four major focus areas: symptom science, wellness, self-management of chronic conditions, and the science of end-of-life and palliative care. The Institute also explores ways in which new innovations and technologies can contribute to advancing nursing science across these four areas. In addition, NINR has a longstanding and continuing commitment to developing the next generation of nurse scientists: those individuals and team members who will carry the field of nursing science into the future. NINR’s research program in symptom science seeks a better understanding of the biological and behavioral aspects of symptoms, with the goal of developing and testing new interventions to reduce the disabling effects of symptoms and improving patient health outcomes and quality of life. Research efforts in wellness investigate the key biological, behavioral, and social factors that promote long-term health and healthy behaviors and prevent the development of illness across health conditions, settings, and the lifespan. Research in wellness is also focused on developing and testing culturally appropriate interventions to promote health and prevent illness in minority and underserved groups. NINR research in self-management seeks to engage individuals and families as active participants in maintaining and improving quality of life while living with a chronic condition or multiple chronic conditions. Self-management research encompasses health strategies that allow an individual and their health care provider to adapt treatments to individual circumstances. As the lead NIH Institute for end-of-life research, NINR supports science to assist individuals, families, and health care professionals in managing the symptoms of advanced, serious illness, and planning for end-of-life decisions. NINR also recognizes that high-quality, evidence-based palliative care is a critical component of maintaining quality of life at any stage of illness, not limited to the end of life. In focusing on innovation and technology, NINR promotes technological advancements that address a range of health care challenges and facilitate the delivery of real-time personalized information to individuals and families, health care providers, and communities. In order to prepare an innovative, diverse, and talented next generation of nurse scientists, NINR supports a variety of training opportunities for scientists and trainees at all career levels, particularly those at an early career stage who are so critical to sustaining the future of innovative research and high quality health care. NINR supports individual and institutional pre- and postdoctoral research fellowships, as well as career development awards, and sponsors numerous ‘research intensives’ for nurse scientists at all career levels. NINR’s Division of Intramural Research conducts basic and clinical research on the interactions among molecular mechanisms underlying symptoms and environmental influences on individual health outcomes. The program focuses on the biological and behavioral underpinnings of symptoms of chronic conditions, including digestive disorders, cancer-related fatigue, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress disorders, as well as clinical interventions to alleviate symptoms.","(Project Grants) FY 15 $103,126,002; FY 16 est $107,957,000; and FY 17 est $106,893,000 - Research Grants.

The Smart Prosecution Initiative seeks to encourage exploration of new solutions to public safety concerns, as well as internal operations and organizational structure, while employing research partners at the problem definition stage through assessment of strategies and solutions. Some creative solutions developed by prosecutors around the country include changing how their organizations prioritize cases, using zone/geographic prosecution, using crime analysis tools to reduce gun violence, nuisance abatement, crime prevention through environmental design, drug-free and prostitute-free zones, restorative justice, community courts, truancy abatement, diversion programs, crime analysis, and cyber-crime strategies to improve public safety. Prosecutors are becoming partnership builders who bring the police, the community, and other criminal justice and local agencies together to find ways they can work together to solve problems in their jurisdictions.The goal of Smart Prosecution is to develop a body of knowledge about data-driven strategies—innovative, best practice, or evidenced-based—as they are implemented by prosecutors. BJA sought applications from state, local, or tribal prosecutor agencies interested in testing data-driven approaches that address one or more of the following three goals: • Promoting fair, impartial, and expeditious pursuit of justice; • Ensuring safe communities; and • Promoting integrity in the prosecution profession and effective coordination in the criminal justice system.","(Project Grants (Discretionary)) FY 15 $2,208,239; FY 16 est $2,500,000; and FY 17 est $5,000,000",15-0404-0-1-754,http://www.bja.gov,"Carmen Facciolo U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance,810 7th Street NW",Washington,DC,20531,(202) 616-6500

Smith-Lever (3b) & (c) Capacity Grants (formerly known as Formula Funds)a) Cooperative Extension Programs at 1862 Land-Grant Institutions (formerly known as 3b & c Formula Funds) These funds are used by institutions eligible to receive funds under the Act of Congress approved July second, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, entitled ‘‘An Act donating public lands to the several States and Territories which may provide colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts’’ (Twelfth Statutes at Large, page five hundred and three) (“1862 Land-grant Institutions”), for the development of practical applications of research knowledge and giving of instruction and practical demonstrations of existing or improved practices or technologies in agriculture, uses of solar energy with respect to agriculture, home economics, and rural energy, and subjects relating thereto to persons not attending or resident in 1862 Land-grant Institutions in the several communities, and imparting information on those subjects through demonstrations, publications, and otherwise and for the necessary printing and distribution of information in connection with the subjects.The purpose of this funding is to conduct agricultural extension work.(b) Cooperative Extension Programs at 1862 Land-Grant Institutions (Special Needs) – The purpose of this funding is to increase the level of agricultural extension work. These funds are used to support extension activities identified in the eligible institution’s approved 5-Year Plan of Work. Special Needs funds are allocated to a State Cooperative Extension Service to fulfill a purpose or overcome a condition peculiar to the State, as compared to the country as a whole, or for a purpose not normally a part of the continuing extension program.(c) Smith-Lever Special Needs Program Funds support innovative extension education approaches to addressing risks, hazards and disasters. The Cooperative Extension Service (CES) has an important role in reducing the impact of disasters through extension education. The Extension Special Needs program sponsors targeted projects that enable CES to assist in preparing for, providing an educational response to, and recovering from disasters. Education programming funded by this program will help communities, families and individuals become more self-sustaining by strengthening and increasing their resiliency to disaster. Some types of hazards and disaster related events funded in previous years include uncertainties caused by losses of economic infrastructure, severe weather or other natural disasters, security breaches, human disease, or high consequence animal diseases and plant pests.There has been an increase in public awareness regarding the number and severity of disaster type critical incidents involving earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, wildfire, drought, contagious disease, and terrorist events. The National Academy of Sciences Committee on Environment and Natural Resources and the Subcommittee on Disaster Reduction of the National Science and Technology Council have acknowledged the many effective roles that the Cooperative Extension System (CES) has played in disaster preparedness, response and remediation. Within the states and territories, the CES has repeatedly served as the trusted community organization that has helped to enable families, communities, and businesses to successfully prepare for, respond to and cope with disaster losses and critical incidents. Once a disaster has occurred, the local extension outreach includes: 1) Communicating practical science-based risk information, 2) Developing relevant educational experiences and programs, 3) Working with individuals and communities to open new communication channels, and 4) Mitigating losses and facilitating recovery. Never was this more evident than after hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005 and during the 2008 Midwestern Summer flooding. During and after these incidents, local Extension agents served as a critical communication node throughout affected urban and rural areas, particularly when traditional communication systems were temporarily overwhelmed or destroyed. The Extension Special Needs RFA encourages proposals that specifically address one or more of the following six key target areas: 1. Education and Technical assistance through inter-disciplinary and multi-state disaster training programs and demonstration projects for problem solving, especially those which build upon already existing strengths, contribute to or expand the EDEN and/or eXtension educational materials related to disaster preparation, mitigation, response and recovery; 2. Collaboration with Federal, state and local agencies and other disaster relief organizations to support education and service activities that enhance recovery of impacted rural communities, schools, businesses and agricultural-based activities; 3. Long range family, community and regional planning projects that will enhance implementation of programs that serve public needs in preparation for, during and after emergency situations within impacted States and across impacted regions; 4. Communication delivery of key information that meets end-users’ needs in a timely fashion with consideration of potentially limited communication channels due to disaster situations; 5. Dissemination of credible, science-based information that is reliable and easily accessible even if electronic access is compromised; and 6. Integrated Research and Extension Planning Projects (up to $15,000) are intended to provide assistance to applicants in bringing together teams for the development of highly competitive grant proposals where extension personnel would apply for large grants (in excess of $250,000) from other grant programs (e.g., the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative and etc…) and lead nationally important disaster prevention, protection and mitigation projects. Fundable projects should support education and extension activities which: 1. Reduce risk through planning, disaster preparedness and emergency response by improving communication between the public, community leaders, state and Federal agencies; 2. Develop strategies and educational materials and/or programming in the area of emergency planning, infrastructure design and disaster recovery operation; 3. Develop community networks that provide real-time disaster education information; and/or 4. Develop or expand educational materials regarding disaster issues suitable for use and distribution by the Extension Disaster Education Network (EDEN) or the eXtension Community of Practice working with disaster planning.(d) CSRS Retirement Contributions Program (aka ERET CSRS Retirement) Capacity grants (formerly known as ""Formula"") authorized under the CSRS Retirement Contributions Program.
