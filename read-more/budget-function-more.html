<p>
    This analysis was conducted using agency account obligation data reported to 
    USAspending.gov, which is available to the public. Each reported account is 
    aligned to a single Budget Function and is further broken out by the dollars 
    obligated under each Object Class 
    (data can be found via the TAS/categories endpoint within the DATA Act API).
</p>
<p>
    Summarizing across all agency accounts can provide the total dollars obligated 
    under each unique combination of Budget Function and Object Class which populates 
    the visualization above. The data used in this tool was pulled as of December 2017.
