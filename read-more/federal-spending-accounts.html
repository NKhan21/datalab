<p>We conducted this analysis by organizing the spending data reported to USAspending.gov in a way
  that reflects the structure of the federal government. To do this, we matched federal accounts
  with the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Master Account File, which lists agencies and
  their Treasury accounts as presented in the government-wide budget. We based this analysis on
  File A information reported to USAspending.gov. The diagram indicates agencies that don't have
  sub-agencies; these agencies continue directly to the federal accounts branch. We used OMB's
  sub-agency taxonomy, in which DOD sub-agencies appear more as functional accounts than sub-agencies.</p>
<p>
    The data reflects federal account balances and obligations through the end of Fiscal Year 2017.
    The data used in this tool was updated as of January 2018.
