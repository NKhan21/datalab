<p>We conducted this analysis by organizing the spending data reported to USAspending.gov 
    in a way that reflects the structure of the federal government. 
    To do this, we matched federal accounts with the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Master Account File, 
    which lists agencies and their Treasury accounts as presented in the government-wide budget.

<p>
    We based this analysis on File A information reported to USAspending.gov. 
    The diagram indicates agencies that don't have sub-agencies; these agencies continue directly 
    to the federal accounts branch. We used OMB's sub-agency taxonomy, and as such, 
    DOD sub-agencies appear more as functional accounts than sub-agencies. 
    The data used in this tool was updated as of January 2018.
