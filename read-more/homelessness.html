<p>To accurately determine the amount the federal government spends addressing homelessness, we reviewed federal program
        descriptions using the CFDA, looking for any mention of keywords related to homelessness. We then developed a ranking 
        system to assess whether individuals experiencing homelessness would directly benefit from these programs, 
        keeping only the most relevant programs in our dataset.
</p>
<p>
    We also categorized these programs by the type of service they provide. 
    For example, the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program provides services to homeless veterans seeking 
    meaningful employment, which we classified as employment-related. We presented these programs to the 
    US Interagency Council on Homelessness, which provided feedback on our ranking system.
</p>
<p>
    We used this dataset to identify all grant spending from USAspending.gov related to the programs we 
    determined to have a direct relation to homelessness. As part of our analysis, we identified two categories 
    of grant awards in USAspending.gov data that are relevant to our work: those that were awarded to a 
    Continuum of Care area (an administrative region recognized by HUD) or fell within its geographic area, 
    and those that didn’t have specific location data or that applied to multiple areas within a state. 
</p>
<p>
    To create our map visualization, we mapped funding amounts for the programs that fell within 
    Continuum of Care areas using shape files provided by HUD. The data used in this data story 
    was updated as of January 2018.
</p>
<p>
    We conducted this analysis using data from the following sources:
    <ul>
        <li>Federal grant award data from USAspending.gov</li>
        <li>Federal program descriptions from the Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA)</li>
        <li>Counts of people experiencing homelessness from the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD’s) 2017 Point-in-Time count</li>
    </ul>
